The following is a conversation with Ilya Sutskever,

Co-founder and chief scientist of OpenAI,

one of the most cited computer scientists in history,

with over 165,000 citations,

and to me,

one of the most brilliant and insightful minds ever in the field of deep learning.

There are very few people in this world who I'd rather talk to and
brainstorm with about deep learning,

intelligence, and life in general than Ilya on and off the mic.
